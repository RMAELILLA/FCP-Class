# Write a class named Pet, which should have the following data attributes:
# __name (for the name of the pet)
# __animan_type (for the type of animal that a pet is. Example values are 'Dog', 'Cat', and 'Bird')
# __age (for the pet's age)

# The pet class should have an __init__ method that creates these attributes. It should also have the following methods:
# setName() # This method assigns a value to the __name field.
# setAnimal_type() # This method assigns a value to the __animal_type field.
# setAge # This method assigns a value to the __age field.
# getName() # This method returns the value of the __name field.
# getAnimal_type() # This method returns the value of the __animal_type field.
# getAge() # This method returns the value of the __age field.

# Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class and prompts the user to enter the name, type, age of his or her pet.
# This data should be stored as the object's attributes.
# Use the object's accessor methods to retrieve the pet's name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.
