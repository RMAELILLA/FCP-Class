# FCP-Class
Python program that run three class such as; Fan, Car, and Pet for abstraction and encapsulation problems.
    
# ❓ How this program run: Fan Class
- Save the corrected code into three separate files: FClass.py, FCUserDisplay.py, and TestFan.py.
- Make sure all three files (FClass.py, FCUserDisplay.py, and TestFan.py) are in the same directory.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the files are located using the cd command.
- Run the TestFan.py file using the Python interpreter by executing the following command:
_Note: Make sure you have Python installed and added to your system's PATH environment variable._
- The program will start running and prompt you to input the properties for the first fan and then the second fan.
- Follow the instructions in the terminal to provide the required inputs for each fan.
- After entering the inputs for both fans, the program will display the properties of each fan, including the speed, radius, color, and whether the fan is turned on.
- See the output in the terminal to see the fan properties for both fans.

# ❓ How this program run: Car Class
- It prompts the user to enter the year model of the car.
- The user inputs the year model.
- It prompts the user to enter the make of the car.
- The user inputs the make.
- It creates a Car object with the provided year model and make.
- It enters a loop to accelerate the car five times.
- Inside the loop, it calls the accelerate() method on the car object.
- It retrieves the current speed of the car using the get_speed() method.
- It displays the current speed to the user.
- The loop repeats four more times, increasing the speed each time.
- After the acceleration loop, it enters another loop to brake the car five times.
- Inside the loop, it calls the brake() method on the car object.
- It retrieves the current speed of the car using the get_speed() method.
- It displays the current speed to the user.
- The loop repeats four more times, decreasing the speed each time.
- The program execution ends, and the program exits.
_During the execution of the program, you will see the current speed of the car displayed after each acceleration and brake action. The program simulates the acceleration and braking of a car and allows you to observe the changing speed._
